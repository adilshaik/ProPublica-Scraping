**Notes on above code:**

- **Importing Libraries:** A number of Python modules are first imported into the script, including BeautifulSoup for web scraping, csv for working with CSV files, requests for sending HTTP requests, and pytesseract for optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from photos.
- **Setting pytesseract Path:** It sets the path for the Tesseract OCR executable. Tesseract is used to extract text from images.
- **get\_investments\_iframe\_url Function:** This method accepts an input URL (main\_url), performs an HTTP GET request to the URL, and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content. It searches the HTML for iframes and determines whether any of them have a src attribute with the value "InvestmentsCorpStockSchedule." If discovered, it uses the iframe source URL to call the get\_csv\_investments\_corp\_bonds\_schedule\_tbl function.
- **get\_csv\_investments\_corp\_bonds\_schedule\_tbl Function:** This method accepts an iframe URL as an input, sends an HTTP GET request to the URL, and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content. It searches the HTML for tables and pulls data from the rows and columns of those tables. The information is then saved in a CSV file with the name "InvestmentsCorpBondsScheduleTbl.csv."
- **extract\_and\_save\_to\_text Function:** Text from a PDF file can be extracted using this function. It accepts as inputs a text output file (output\_file) and the path to a PDF file (pdf\_path). Each PDF page is first turned into an image using the pdf2image package, and each image's text is then extracted using Tesseract OCR. The output text file is where the retrieved text is saved.
- **Main Script:** In the main part of the script, it first prompts the user to enter a year. If the user enters "2020," it calls get\_investments\_iframe\_url to scrape data from a specific web page. If the user enters "2019," it assumes there is a PDF file named "2019.pdf" in the same directory and calls extract\_and\_save\_to\_text to extract text from the PDF and save it to "extracted\_text.txt."
